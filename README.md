<h2 align="center">Model Usage in UpdateBook and GetById Methods</h2>

### Overview
This README outlines the implementation of specific models for the input and output of the UpdateBook and GetById methods in our project.

### Objectives
- Create distinct models for inputs and outputs of these methods.
- Avoid direct use of entity models as inputs/outputs in the project.

### Implementation Details
- **UpdateBook Model**: Define a model for updating book details, including necessary fields like title, author, genre, etc.
- **GetById Output Model**: Create a model representing the output data when fetching book details by ID.

### Guidelines
- Ensure models encapsulate only relevant data, enhancing data security and integrity.
- Validate model data before processing in the business logic.
